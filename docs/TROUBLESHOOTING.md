In addition to normal operational issues that you can encounter with any distributed application, since Twistlock is meant to block certain actions on a machine by design, sometimes it can interfere with intentional actions you are trying to take on your cluster, e.g. upgrading OpenShift. To help deal with this, the official Twistlock documentation has a good repository of common operational and integration issues encountered when using the application and how to get around them. It is available [here](https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting/collect_debug_data.html).
