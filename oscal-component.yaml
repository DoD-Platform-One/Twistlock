          Prisma Cloud can scan containers to check of the container is secured or not. It gives you the list of the packages that are vulnerable to the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and it also prompts you to remove the compliance vulnerabilities.
          Prisma Cloud can easily remove the vulnerabilities as the scan also suggests the user about the package that is vulnerable, the location of the package, and the version the vulnerability is fixed in.

          The image scan reports of Prisma Cloud show the following per-vulnerability timestamps:
          Age of the vulnerability based on the discovery date. This is the first date that the Prisma Cloud scanner found the vulnerability.
          Age of the vulnerability based on its published date. This represents the date the vulnerability was announced to the world.
          Timestamped findings are useful for time-based SLAs for remediating vulnerabilities.
